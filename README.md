Sirvy is the best

i'm thinking some simple crud stuff stored locally, auth handled by firebase. maybe storage on firebase? though i don't know what i'd need to store.

don't know whether i'm gonna do the texting on the front or back end. probably wouldn't be too bad on the back end. pass req.body back for the number and message fields. we'll see.

then get the sent back data and some data visualization.
